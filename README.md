# FairCredit-Data120-

This was made as a component of a larger project for my Data 120 (Intro to Data Science Ethics) class.

Description:
A machine learning pipeline for credit score classification using logistic regression. The project preprocesses data, encodes categorical variables, and handles missing values before training a model. It evaluates performance and fairness by analyzing accuracy disparity and demographic parity differences across gender groups.

Data obtained via Kaggle.
